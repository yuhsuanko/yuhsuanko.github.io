I’m Yu-Hsuan (Monica) Ko, a data scientist with a passion for fighting financial crime through machine learning and data-driven insights.

From developing anti-money laundering models to building RPA pipelines that automate manual processes, my work sits at the intersection of compliance, artificial intelligence, and impact. My journey started in Taiwan, where I learned to balance business thinking with technical depth. It brought me to Chicago, where I’ve deepened my understanding of how data can build trust and improve lives.

But my story isn’t just about technology. It’s about how I choose problems that matter.

### Purpose over Prestige

In an industry where "scale" often overshadows significance, I strive to create tools that uncover hidden risks, protect people, and align with ethical values. I’ve turned thousands of false positives into real insight. I’ve seen how one well-designed model can prevent financial damage, support compliance teams, and preserve trust across systems.

It’s not about the most complex model. It’s about the most meaningful one.

### Automation as Empowerment

People often think of automation as replacing human work. But I’ve come to see it differently.

To me, automation is a way to give people time back—to investigate, to strategize, to think. When I created RPA workflows that saved hundreds of hours per year, what excited me wasn’t the speed. It was the freedom it gave people to work better.

Technology should amplify human strengths, not bury them under dashboards and alerts.

### Bridging Worlds

With experience spanning data science, banking, business, and education, I’ve learned to speak more than one language—technical, strategic, and human. Whether it's explaining a fraud network to a compliance officer or training non-technical teams to use Python, I aim to bridge gaps and bring people together.

Data is only powerful if it's understood. I want to be the person who makes that happen.

Some people see data as cold and abstract. But to me, it's one of the most human tools we have—full of stories, risks, and the power to build trust. This is the path I’ve chosen. And I’m only just getting started.
