As summer approaches and I wrap up my third quarter of grad school, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my U.S. internship search journey.

While I recognize that I still have much to improve, this experience taught me more than I anticipated about myself, the job market, and the true value of growth through discomfort.

### Searching with a Cold Resume

At first, I leaned heavily on cold applications. I submitted my resume to hundreds of job postings, completed over 10 virtual assessments, and interviewed with nearly 10 hiring managers.

Coming from Taiwan, I was used to a job market where strong credentials often speak for themselves. I thought I could do the same here: build a good resume, apply online, and let the results speak. But in the U.S., that wasn’t enough.

Despite being told that referrals and coffee chats mattered, I hesitated. I’m naturally more introverted, and the idea of reaching out to strangers felt daunting. So I focused on polishing my resume and kept applying.

But over time, I felt like I was sending my energy into a void. I thought landing interviews meant success, but I hadn’t truly learned how to prepare for them.

### Interviewing Isn’t Just Answering Questions

My first hiring manager interview came in November. I didn’t know what to expect or how to talk about my work beyond bullet points. I didn’t know how to explain *why* I cared, or how to show that I understood the team’s goals.

Some managers told me my experience was impressive, but I kept falling short. That forced me to reflect: if I was getting interviews but not offers, something had to change.

So I shifted my mindset. I started thinking of interviews not just as hurdles, but as opportunities to learn how to tell my story better.

### Learning to Reach Out

I also began initiating coffee chats. It wasn’t easy. I spent hours researching people, drafting messages, and psyching myself up just to send them.

But every conversation taught me something about industry expectations, role responsibilities, and how others had navigated similar paths. These chats helped me see beyond my resume and rebuild confidence when rejections stacked up.

It turns out people are more generous than I thought, especially when you show curiosity and humility.

### Speaking Honestly, Not Perfectly

The turning point came when I stopped trying to give perfect answers and started speaking honestly.

I practiced sharing why I cared about the work, what I’d learned, and what kind of teammate I hoped to be. Suddenly, the stories that once felt "too ordinary" became my strengths.

Eventually, I found clarity about what I value in a team, how I want to grow, and how to turn rejection into resilience.

### Three Lessons I’ll Take into Full-Time Recruiting:

1. **Experience matters, but how you tell your story matters more.**
2. **Coffee chats aren’t just about referrals—they’re about perspective.**
3. **Every interview is a mirror. Use it to understand yourself better.**

I’m still learning, but I hope this story helps someone out there feel a little more hopeful, a little more seen.
