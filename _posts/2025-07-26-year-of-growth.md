After completing three quarters of my Masterâ€™s program in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago, I am now approaching my final term before graduation. This past year has been filled with personal and academic growth, as well as meaningful cultural insights.

I arrived in the U.S. last September, marking my first experience living in the U.S.. I entered an all-English environment for both my studies and daily life. Transitioning from a Mandarin-speaking background to an English-speaking academic setting has been incredibly challenging. Unlike many of my peers who had prior experience living in the U.S., I had to learn everything from scratch, cooking for myself, navigating life independently, and adapting to an entirely new educational culture.

The courses here are rich and project-driven, often delivered in small class settings. I've worked on multiple hands-on projects that bridge theory with real-world applications. Through these experiences, I have gained not only new technical skills but also valuable experience in communication and teamwork. Hearing my classmates ask insightful questions and my professors share diverse perspectives has helped me reflect on where I need to grow both technically and professionally.

Beyond the classroom, I have also gained insights into the job search culture and professional expectations in the U.S. This journey has taught me how to think critically, work across cultures, and approach problems from a broader, more global perspective.
